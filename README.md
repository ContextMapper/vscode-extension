This repository contains a VS Code extension for Context Mapper and the CML language.

**NOTE:** Only first tests and project setup yet. 

**TODO's:**
 * Syntax highlighting has to be implemented in `syntaxes/cml.tmLanguage.json`
 * add menus and actions for refactorings and generators
 
## Building and Running the Extension
 * To run VS Code with the extension, simply call `./gradlew startCode`
   * Precondition: VS Code must be installed and available from the commandline with `code`
